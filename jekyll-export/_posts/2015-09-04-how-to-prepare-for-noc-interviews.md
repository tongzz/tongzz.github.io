  Whether your <a href="#NOC">NOC</a> interview is tomorrow, a week later or a year later, I thought I will share with you some tips and advice on how to prepare for the interviews. I just came back from the 12-month program located in San Francisco Bay Area, if you are keen on what I&#8217;ve done over the past twelve months, <a title="What I’ve Learnt Spending 365 Days as a Marketer in Silicon Valley" href="http://zetongteoh.com/what-ive-learnt-spending-365-days-marketer-silicon-valley/" target="_blank">read this</a>. Before we begin, here are some disclaimers to take note:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Disclaimer #1: You would not find the interview format here. The interview format changes rapidly, so there is never a fixed answer to that. But, the character traits they look for in the candidates are generally the same. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Disclaimer #2: Reading this does not guarantee you a position in NOC, but I’m glad you are taking the initiative to learn and prepare for the interviews.  Now, read on to find out more!</span>

#### <span class="s1">If your interview is 1 year or more away..</span> {.p1}

<p class="p1">
  I&#8217;m so glad that you are preparing for NOC this early; the interviewers love people who are well-prepared and fully understand what they are signing themselves for. You have plenty of time to get yourself ready for the program, here are some the things you could do:
</p>

<h5 class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
  Apply for a startup internship
</h5>

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-105 size-large" src="http://zetongteoh.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/startups-at-blk71-1024x642.jpeg" alt="startups at blk71" width="1024" height="642" />](http://zetongteoh.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/startups-at-blk71.jpeg)

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

During the summer break, get yourself an internship with a local startup. Working in a startup is vastly different to that of a big corporation; you will find yourself juggling with many different roles and working closely with the cofounders. Almost everyone who has interned at a startup said that they have learnt a lot from the short stint because the everyday work focuses on solving problems for the company.

For starters, you can try searching for internships on <a href=" http://startupjobs.asia/" target="_blank">StartupJobs.asia</a> or <a href="http://glints.com" target="_blank">Glints.com</a>. Startups are often made up of small teams and lack the proper HR resources, so if by any chance the company has not responded you via the jobs portals, email them directly stating that you would like to work for them!

<h5 style="text-align: left;">
  Attend N-House events
</h5>

</p>

All N-House residents are part of the NOC program and N-House is a block located in Prince George&#8217;s Park of NUS. By attending their weekly events on Wednesdays, you often find yourself surrounded by NOC alumni, and you can listen to their experience of the program and find out more about the college you&#8217;re applying for. Look out for <a href="http://enterprise.nus.edu.sg/event/" target="_blank">N-House events</a> here, <a href="http://nhouse.sg/" target="_blank">read their blog</a> to find out more about what they do at the events and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NHouse.sg" target="_blank">follow them on Facebook</a> to be notified for all upcoming events! There is one interesting event coming up next Wednesday, Sept 9, titled <a href="http://enterprise.nus.edu.sg/event/index/505#" target="_blank">&#8220;The Business Side of Tech&#8221;</a>, which I&#8217;ve RSVP-ed yes.

##### Read up about startups and technology

While you don&#8217;t have to know how Google&#8217;s self-driving cars nor the blockchain technology work, you don&#8217;t want to sound like you know nothing about the tech scene during the interviews. Minimally, you should know who are some of the prominent startups in Singapore. Make it a habit to read up regularly from the articles in <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/" target="_blank">TechinAsia</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>. If you don&#8217;t have a habit of reading, here&#8217;s some quick fixes:

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">
    <span class="s1">Follow their Facebook pages, so that while you are scrolling down to the news feed, you can catch on some interesting tech articles</span>
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    Subscribe to their email newsletters with your favorite email address. This way, you will read it whenever you check for emails.
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    Make these sites your homepage
  </li>
</ul>

Most importantly, you must know the difference between startups and small businesses. I highly encourage you to read Paul Graham&#8217;s essay <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html" target="_blank">&#8220;Startup = Growth&#8221;</a>.

<span id="1week"> </span>

#### <span class="s1">If your interview is 1 week away..</span> {.p1}

<p class="p1">
  It will be by now too late to apply for an internship to make a meaningful impact on you during the interviews, I would encourage you to keep yourself updated on the latest tech news and attempt to form opinions on the issues.
</p>

When reading the news, try to form your opinions on those current affairs. Ask yourself questions like these when you read the news:

  * Is there any acquisition news for a regional startup? 
      * What do you think of the business idea that got acquired?
      * Was it because of the execution, or does it seem more like an acqui-hire?
  * Is there a new form of technology/new product that was discovered or experimented? 
      * What are the implications to the existing industries and businesses?
      * Do you think the new technology/product is a feasible, sustainable business?
  * Is there another startup that raised another insane round of funding? 
      * On what basis do you think this startup has raised so much money? (Team members, business idea, number of users, etc.)
      * Is the business model new/unique, and is it hard to replicate?
  * Is there news for a macro trends report? 
      * What are some of the statistics which come as a surprise?
      * Can you brainstorm a few business ideas based on these trends you have just read about?

&nbsp;

##### Find out anything you can about the college of your first choice

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-114 size-full" src="http://zetongteoh.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/noc-colleges.png" alt="Characteristics of NOC Colleges" width="563" height="283" />](http://zetongteoh.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/noc-colleges.png)

<span class="s1">Each NOC colleges has their own characteristics. You should have a very strong reason why you are applying to your first-choice college. Talk to any seniors that you can find and find out about the colleges you are interested in. It will be ideal if you can find the alumni who have gone to the college of your choice, and ask them specifically which sector has the most partnering companies and what types of jobs were offered to them. </span>Also, it will be great if you can talk to the seniors of your major who has gone on NOC. Find out what jobs they have taken up and how they have aligned their major to get the jobs.
  
<span id="1day"> </span>

#### <span class="s1">If your interview is 1 day away..</span> {.p1}

<p class="p1">
  There really isn&#8217;t much you can do to improve on your hard skills with one day left, so my only advice to prepare you for tomorrow&#8217;s interview would be:
</p>

<h5 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">
  Bring out the enthusiasm and positive attitude in you
</h5>

It is easy to tell when one person is passionate about something; there is something alluring about that. At tomorrow&#8217;s interview, you need to show them your interest to know more about startups and technology. And that you are willing to humble and learn, that is the positive attitude that will touch many people to give you a shot at it.

&nbsp;

#### On the final note,

I&#8217;m glad you are preparing for the interview because it shows how much you care. If you didn&#8217;t manage to get pass the interviews this time round, apply again the next round because tenacity is also a trait in entrepreneurs!

On the other hand, it almost doesn&#8217;t matter whether you are accepted into the program because you shouldn&#8217;t let NOC limit your potential. If you think you are capable of something big, then prove it. You can do whatever you want with or without the NOC program. Although he did not apply for NOC, Kenneth Lou, the co-founder of <a href="http://www.novelsys.co/" target="_blank">Novelsys</a>, has proven to everyone that your world is only as big as you imagine it to be.
